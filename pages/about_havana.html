          <h2>Founding of Havana</h2>
          <img src="../images/about-havana/early%20havana.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Havana's storied past can be traced back to November 16, 1519, when
            the Spanish explorer Diego Velázquez, acting on behalf of the
            Spanish monarchy, established the city's third and final settlement,
            which still stands today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the 16th century, Havana endured repeated destruction at
            the hands of French pirates and corsairs. To safeguard its future,
            the Spanish Crown invested in military defenses at the entrance of
            Havana Bay, fortifying the city as the best-protected settlement in
            the New World.

          <p>
            The 17th century witnessed significant expansion in Havana, marked
            by the construction of imposing civil and religious edifices.
            Notable additions included the San Agustin convent, the completion
            of El Morro Castle, the Dorotea de la Luna fountain in La Chorrera,
            the Santo Angel Custodio church, the San Lazaro hospital, the Santa
            Teresa monastery, the San Felipe Neri convent, and the 1728
            establishment of the Royal and Pontifical University of San Jeronimo
            within the confines of the San Juan de Letran convent.

          <h2>Havana in the XVIII Century</h2>
          <img src="../images/about-havana/British.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            By the mid-18th century, Havana boasted a population exceeding
            70,000 residents. On June 6, 1762, Havana faced a formidable British
            fleet comprising over 50 ships and 14,000 soldiers. After a
            two-month siege, the English forces captured the city, under the
            command of Sir Georges Keppel, who ruled for eleven months.
          </p>
          <p>
            In mid-1763, Havana was returned to Spanish control in exchange for
            Florida. As Spain's trade monopoly waned, Havana's prosperity
            soared, eventually becoming a free port in 1818. The city embraced
            luxury, fashion, and cultural vibrancy, earning it the moniker
            "Paris of the Antilles."

          <p>
            The early 19th century witnessed the arrival of the German
            naturalist Alexander Von Humboldt, who marveled at the vitality of
            Havana's port. In 1837, Havana inaugurated the first railway
            section, spanning 51 kilometers between Havana and Güines, primarily
            for sugar transportation. This marked Cuba's transition to becoming
            the fifth country globally with a railway system. Throughout the
            century, Havana flourished with cultural hubs like the opulent
            Teatro Tacon and the Coliseo Theater.
          </p>
          <p>
            The late 19th century saw the conclusion of Spanish colonization in
            Cuba, with Havana entering the 20th century under U.S. occupation
            following the sinking of the American battleship Maine in its port,
            which led to the United States' involvement in the island's affairs.

          <p>
            In the 1930s, under American influence, Havana experienced
            substantial growth with the construction of sumptuous hotels,
            casinos, and magnificent nightclubs like the Focsa, Habana Libre,
            and Hotel Nacional. Havana became a hub of gaming and indulgence.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with Fidel Castro Ruz's victory in the 1959 Revolution,
            profound social transformations unfolded, particularly in education,
            public health, and infrastructure development. A comprehensive
            network of educational institutions and healthcare services was
            established, ensuring accessibility for all citizens.

            Havana's historic center earned the distinction of being designated
            a National Monument by the Cuban Government in 1976 and a UNESCO
            World Heritage Site in 1982.
          </p>

          <p>
            Havana's global appeal was further validated when it was named one
            of the New7Wonders Cities in 2014. The city's enchanting ambiance,
            warm hospitality, and the jovial spirit of its residents were
            celebrated when it officially received its status as one of the
            modern world's seven wonders in 2016. A monument and commemorative
            plaque were unveiled at the San Salvador de la Punta Fortress, an
            integral part of Havana's UNESCO heritage, in honor of this
            prestigious recognition.
